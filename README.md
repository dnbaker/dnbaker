### Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

PhD Candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu) department of [Computer Science](https://cs.jhu.edu).
Previously, I was a Bioinformatics Scientist at ARUP Laboratories, where I worked on
cell-free circulating tumor DNA (_ctDNA_) analysis and clinical genomics after my training
in Physics [BS] and Biophysics/Computational Biology [MS].

ðŸ”­ Currently working on similarity search, and clustering, and indexing for large-scale data

#### A quick tour of my interests

1. Practical randomized algorithms

This ranges from libraries providing [sketch data structures](https://github.com/dnbaker/sketch) and [coresets](https://github.com/dnbaker/minocore),
as well as projects using [random projections](https://github.com/dnbaker/frp) and [DCI](https://github.com/dnbaker/DCI).

My work on coresets and clustering is primarily part of the [minocore](https://github.com/dnbaker/minocore) project, with the aims
of providing a standard utility for coreset construction and weighted clustering, especially for exponential family models and shortest-paths metrics.

2. Computational Biology

The [bonsai](https://github.com/dnbaker/bonsai) project provides methods for __metagenomic__ analysis,
along with k-mer encoding/decoding and I/O, while the [Dashing](https://github.com/dnbaker/dashing) performs scalable
sketching and comparison of sequence data.

[BMFtools](https://github.com/dnbaker/bmftools) performs molecular demultiplication over sequencing barcoded data, reducing error rates while eliminating redundant information.
Designed for ctDNA, this method can reduce error rates by orders of magnitude, allowing confident detection of very rare events.

3. General C++

Most of my projects fall into this category, being tool I can reuse in various projects.

Some of my favorites:

- [vec](https://github.com/dnbaker/vec) provides type-generic abstractions over x86-64 vectorization, making it easy to write fast, portable code.
- [kspp](https://github.com/dnbaker/kspp) is an RAII-based variant of kstring from [klib](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib) with extra niceties making appending printf-style formatting easy.
- [aesctr](https://github.com/dnbaker/aesctr) provides STL-style random number generators built on fast aes-ctr and wyhash
- [circularqueue](https://github.com/dnbaker/circularqueue) provides a range-based circular queue container that uses power-of-two sizes
